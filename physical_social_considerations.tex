\chapter{Cyber-Physical-Social Considerations (Lynne/Dave)}

Behavioral considerations - bridging between technology and behavioral aspects

Does automation  make things better? Encourages/discourages?

Which human behavior do TS need to considers? in control room and for consumers? Discussion: theoretical assumptions vs actual behavior

How do people actually behave? (e.g. in situations like now in Ercot Feb 2021) Which choices do they have? How do they use them?

+ lessons from Covid/BLM/... - complex social interdependencies (Lynne has a few considerations to include)
Connect that to resiliency analysis (What are good metrics? Given these metrics, how do TS contribute in achieving them?)
